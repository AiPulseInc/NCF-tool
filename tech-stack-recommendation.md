Here is the **Tech Stack Recommendation** section formatted in Markdown:

```markdown
## 4. Tech Stack Recommendation

- **Python + PyQt5 / PyQt6**
  Best suited for building complex UIs with advanced table handling and layout flexibility.

- **pyscard**
  Library for **NFC communication** using PC/SC compatible smart card readers.
```

Would you like me to combine all sections into a single, complete Markdown document?
